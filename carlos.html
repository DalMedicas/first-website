        <h1>CARLOS TRACJETORY</h1>
        <p>
          Carlos Alberto Torres, often referred to as "Capita," was a Brazilian
          football legend whose journey left an indelible mark on the sport.
          Born on July 17, 1944, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Carlos Alberto was
          destined for greatness on the football pitch<br />
          <br />Capita's professional career began with Fluminense in the early
          1960s, where he showcased his defensive prowess as a right-back. His
          remarkable skills and leadership qualities quickly earned him
          recognition, and he became an integral part of Fluminense's success in
          domestic and international competitions<br /><br />
          However, it was during his time with Santos FC that Carlos Alberto
          Torres truly ascended to the pinnacle of football. In the late 1960s,
          he played a pivotal role in Santos' formidable team, which also
          featured the legendary Pelé. Together, they achieved significant
          success, including winning the Copa Libertadores and the
          Intercontinental Cup in 1963 <br /><br />
          One of the defining moments of Carlos Alberto's career occurred in the
          1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico. As the captain of the Brazilian
          national team, he led a squad widely regarded as one of the greatest
          in football history. Carlos Alberto's iconic goal in the World Cup
          final against Italy, where he rifled in a pass from Pelé, captured the
          essence of Brazil's attacking style and secured their third World Cup
          title<br /><br />
          Carlos Alberto Torres continued his football journey in the domestic
          and international arenas, playing for notable clubs such as
          Fluminense, Flamengo, and the New York Cosmos in the North American
          Soccer League (NASL). His impact extended beyond the pitch, as he
          transitioned into coaching and sports commentary.
