          Sócrates Brasileiro Sampaio de Souza Vieira de Oliveira, commonly
          known as Sócrates, was a Brazilian footballer whose journey left an
          indelible mark on the sport. Born on February 19, 1954, in Belém,
          Brazil, Sócrates was not only a gifted player but also a highly
          intelligent and charismatic figure, earning him the nickname "The
          Doctor" due to his medical degree<br />
          <br />Sócrates rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, showcasing
          his exceptional skills as an attacking midfielder. He possessed a
          unique blend of elegance, vision, and technical prowess, making him a
          standout performer on the field. His career reached its peak during
          his time with Corinthians, one of Brazil's most beloved football
          clubs<br /><br />
          What set Sócrates apart was not only his footballing ability but also
          his deep intellect and principled approach to the game. Off the field,
          he was known for his outspoken views on politics and social issues,
          embodying the belief that football could be a platform for broader
          societal discussions<br /><br />
          A key part of Brazil's national team during the 1982 and 1986 FIFA
          World Cups, Sócrates played a crucial role in orchestrating the team's
          attacking play. His leadership qualities were further evident when he
          captained the national side. Despite Brazil's ultimate disappointment
          in those tournaments, Sócrates' impact was lasting, and his style of
          play influenced future generations of footballers<br /><br />
          Sócrates' footballing journey extended beyond Brazil, with stints in
          Italian football, notably with Fiorentina. His elegant style and flair
          on the ball endeared him to fans across the globe. Despite battling
          injuries during various phases of his career, Sócrates remained a
          revered and influential figure <br />
          <br />
          Off the pitch, Sócrates was a man of principles. He played a pivotal
          role in the Corinthians Democracy movement, advocating for player
          involvement in club decisions. His commitment to social causes and his
          advocacy for democratic values set him apart as a footballer with a
          social conscience.
