        <h1>PELÉ TRACJETORY</h1>
        <p>
          Edson Arantes do Nascimento, better known as Pelé, is considered by
          many to be the greatest soccer player of all time. He was born on
          October 23, 1940, in the city of Três Corações, Minas Gerais,
          Brazil<br />
          <br />Pelé began playing soccer at a very young age, and at the age of
          15, he caught the attention of scouts from Santos Futebol Clube. It
          was at Santos that he began his professional career in 1956. He
          quickly stood out as an exceptional player, scoring over 30 goals in
          his first season<br /><br />
          Over the years, Pelé became the symbol of Santos and one of the
          greatest players in world soccer. He won numerous titles, including
          six Brazilian championships, two Copa Libertadores, and two
          Intercontinental Cups<br /><br />
          In addition to his success at Santos, Pelé also shone on the Brazilian
          national team. He made his debut for the national team in 1957, at
          just 16 years old, and participated in four World Cups, winning in
          1958, 1962, and 1970. Pelé is the only player in history to win three
          World Cup titles<br /><br />
          During his career, Pelé scored more than 1,280 goals in official
          matches, becoming the highest goal scorer in the history of soccer. He
          was known for his exceptional skill, incredible ball control, vision,
          and precise finishing. Pelé was also an iconic leader both on and off
          the field <br />
          <br />
          After 18 years at Santos, Pelé transferred to the New York Cosmos in
          the United States in 1975, concluding his career in 1977. He helped
          popularize soccer in North America and promote the sport worldwide
          <br />
          <br />
          Even after retiring, Pelé remains an influential figure in soccer,
          involved in various activities as a sports ambassador and in social
          campaigns. His career and legacy have made him a sports legend, and
          his journey serves as an example of dedication, talent, and success.
