        <h1>ROBERTO TRACJETORY</h1>
        <p>
          Roberto Carlos, born on April 10, 1973, in Garça, São Paulo, Brazil,
          is widely regarded as one of the greatest left-backs in the history of
          football. His journey from a small town in Brazil to becoming a global
          football icon is a testament to his extraordinary talent, powerful
          free kicks, and enduring success on the pitch<br />
          <br />Carlos began his professional career with the Brazilian club
          Palmeiras in 1991, showcasing his exceptional speed, defensive skills,
          and overlapping runs from the left-back position. His performances
          quickly drew attention, and he earned a move to Europe, signing with
          Inter Milan in 1995. Although his time in Italy was relatively brief,
          Carlos continued to impress with his dynamic style of play<br /><br />
          However, it was during his stint with Real Madrid, which began in
          1996, that Roberto Carlos truly solidified his status as a football
          legend. His partnership with the Galácticos, including Zinedine
          Zidane, Luis Figo, and Ronaldo, led to unprecedented success for the
          club. Carlos played a crucial role in Real Madrid's three consecutive
          UEFA Champions League victories from 1998 to 2002, etching his name in
          football history<br /><br />
          Renowned for his thunderous free kicks, Roberto Carlos scored some of
          the most memorable goals in football, including the iconic bending
          free-kick against France in 1997. His ability to contribute
          offensively from the left-back position revolutionized the role,
          making him a trailblazer for attacking full-backs in the modern
          game<br /><br />
          Carlos's illustrious career also saw him represent the Brazilian
          national team with distinction. He played a key role in Brazil's
          triumph in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, contributing both defensively and
          offensively to the team's success <br />
          <br />
          Beyond his playing career, Roberto Carlos transitioned into coaching
          and administrative roles within football. His impact on the sport
          extends to mentoring and inspiring the next generation of players.
